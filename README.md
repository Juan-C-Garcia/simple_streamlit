Data Description:
The data was derived from and maintained by the MIT Election Data and Science Lab (MEDSL). The data is grouped by year, state, and county and tallied together to form the two election maps. The Euclidean distance is created by filtering the data to the percentage of democrat and republican votes for each state. 

Algorithm Description. 
The algorithms can be divided into three categories: display functions, result functions, and map functions. The display functions are labeled 'display' and create the sidebar select options for year, state, and county. This also allows for the winner of the presidential election to be displayed. The result functions calculate the results for the selected options in the display function. Lastly, the map functions create the maps that depict the selected options, resulting in an image of the United States. 

Ethical Concerns: 
Elections and their results should be viewed in the time and space that they occurred. Looking at data from a screenshot can obfuscate and alter the reality of what occurred. For example, President Barack Obama galvanized supporters who typically do not vote. Both similar and polar opposite to the 2016 presidential bid of Donald Trump, who galvanized supporters who have felt ostracized by politics. This application aims to help them better understand the trends and derive important insights.
